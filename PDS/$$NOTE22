Thanks a lot Sam. Attached are two files, a very small
installation instruction file and the source itself. I've rolled
two separate CSECTS into one, which I think is easier. Earlier
versions had the two CSECTS as separate files, which were to be
combined at link time. There are the improvements that Rob Van
Riel made and a few minor changes that I've made subsequent to
his.

As I said, I don't have mainframe access (or Hercules / MVS)
right now, so it's straight ASCII text. I don't think it has any
funky characters that would cause a problem if uploaded straight
from a PC.  Sorry to cause you more work.

And thanks for all your efforts in the CBT. It's a great
'project' [for lack of a better word]
