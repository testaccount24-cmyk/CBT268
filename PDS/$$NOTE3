Hi Sam,

Attached is a zip of a new version 2.3 of file 268 (RXVSAM, Rexx
access to VSAM files).  I have sent a copy to Mark Winges, the
original author, and he told me to send the new version to you
directly.

There are a number of updates, documented in the new member
$CHNGLOG.  The $$DOC file has also been updated to reflect the
changes.

The new file expands to this pds.
Format is FB/80/27960.

Please let me know if there is anything else I need to change or
do for this submission.

Regards,

Peter Farley
