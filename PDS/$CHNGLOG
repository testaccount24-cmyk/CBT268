Changelog for RXVSAM

2.1 -- add DELETE macros for routines that have been LOADed
(IRXEXCOM and various name / token routines).

2.2 -- locate IEANTxx services by bumping through storage rather
than doing a LOAD. Remove associated DELETEs. Add RXVSAMSG CSECT
at end of this assembly; revise GENMSGS macro. Get IRXEXCOM address
by bumping thru ENVBLOCK (environemnt block) to IRXEXTE (external
address table), rather than doing a LOAD. Remove associated DELETE.
Add required ENVBLOCK & IRXEXTE macros (dsects). Allow rewrite for
an ESDS. (Special thanks to Rob Van Riel for these changes)

2.3 -- Convert to baseless programming (J not B, JNE not BNE,
etc.).  Added SYSTATE ARCHLVL=2 and COPY IEABRC and
CALL ...,LINKINST=BASR in support of baseless structure.
R12 now points to label CONSTANT for LTORG and true constants,
R11 and R10 are no longer used for any purpose.
Executed instructions moved to CONSTANT section for
addressibility.   Hardware pipeline delays may result from this
due to executed instruction not being in the instruction cache.
Now allows both STARTFWD and STARTBWD for ESDS files.
HLASM system variable &SYSDATC used instead of &SYSDATE for
eyecatcher constant.
LA and ST instructions using explicit displ(indexreg) for their
second argument changed to use displ(,basereg) format to avoid
unnecessary index register activity.
SAVE macro added with eyecatcher string to both preserve the
savearea chain and to use standard eyecatcher placement for
module identification.  BAKR and PR are still used to perform
entry and exit from module.
Corrected roundup of record length to next doubleword at label
OPEN310.
IHASTCB macro used to map STCB instead of hard-coded definition.
IFGACB and IFGRPL macros added for ACB and RPL mapping.

All 2.3 changed lines are marked with the string "@PJF" on the right.

Changelog for Other Members

Created change log (this member).
Supplied model assemble and link JCL (ASMRXVS) and model test JCL
(RUNTESTS).
Updated RXVSET EXEC to allocate by either SMS STORCLAS or VOLUME
and take defaults from SYSEXEC in batch (no interactive questions).
Updated RXVTEST? test EXEC's to default to displaying all log
messages in batch.
Updated all EXEC's to exit with RC=16 for IRXJCL execution or for
execution in an OpenMVS shell because TSO ALLOC is not supported
in those environments.
