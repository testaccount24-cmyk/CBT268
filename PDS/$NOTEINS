RXVSAM is the main CSECT. RXVSAMSG, which contains error message
texts, is a separate CSECT. Both CSECTS are in the same source
file.

Only one entry pont is needed as RXVSAM has a V-con for RXVSAMSG.
The load module can be called RXVSAM, which will then be the
function name called by REXX execs. If it's linked under another
name, that name will become the function name.

RXVSAM requires the VSAM macros, as well as IEANT name / token
services.  A few other macros / dsects are required. In most
installations, any copy / macro code will be found in SYS1.MACLIB.
Be sure to include this in your assembly step.

This version is reentrant, and runs in 31-bit mode (AMODE=31,
RMODE=ANY).  Note that different REXX execs can operate against
the same VSAM file (i.e. one exec can open the file, and a different
[called] exec can do reads or writes).

Please let me know any problems, suggestions, feedback, etc. I
can also provide sample execs illustrating the various functions,
just e-mail me.

I hope this proves useful in your work.
